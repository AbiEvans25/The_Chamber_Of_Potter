  <h1>Hufflepuff</h1>

  <p>
    Hufflepuff is one of the four houses founded by Helga Hufflepuff.
  The traits associated with members of the Hufflepuff house:
  <ul>
      <li>Dedication</li>
      <li>Hard work</li>
      <li>Fair play</li>
      <li>Patience</li>
      <li>Loyalty</li>
  </ul>
The house is represented with the colours yellow and black accompanied by a badger. Hufflepuffs are often thought to be less talented witches and wizards becuase Helga Hufflepuff accepted anyone into her house.
The Hufflepuff common room is located near the kitchens and is accessed through tapping a rythm on a barrel.

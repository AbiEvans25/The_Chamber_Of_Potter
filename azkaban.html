<h1>Azkaban</h1>

<p>
Azkaban is Great Britainâ€™s wizard prison located in the North Sea. The fortress was built and has been used as a prison since 1718. The use of charms allows Azkaban to be hidden from muggles. The soul sucking beings, the Dementors, are the guards of the prison, preventing inmates from escaping. Only one individual has ever escaped from Azkaban unassisted was Sirius Black, the great Marauder who was framed for the murder of his friend Peter Pettigrew and dozens of innocent muggles.
